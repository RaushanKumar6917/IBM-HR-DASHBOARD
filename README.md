An HR dashboard is a business intelligence tool that summarizes HR key performance indicators (KPIs) and HR records. It can provide valuable insights for HR professionals to make data-driven decisions regarding employee demographics and tenure.
**An HR dashboard can: **
Summarize and present data
Interactive HR dashboards split a single screen into several individual cells or widgets that summarize and present data through numbers, graphs, tables, and various other visuals.
Track patterns and predict what will happen next
A good dashboard uses data software to track patterns and predict what will happen next.
Provide a dynamic overview
An HR dashboard provides a slice-and-dice overview of the workforce, their performance, absence, and turnover.
Help HR staff make vital decisions
The dashboards summarize important metrics and determine how specific metrics correlate so that the HR department understands their team's productivity.
